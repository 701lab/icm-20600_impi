# icm-20600_impi

**icm-20600_impi** is icm-20600 implementation-independent library. Implementation-independent (impi for short) means that this library can be used on any device from any manufacturer: STM, TI, NXP, Atmel with whatever architecture MCU or MPU uses. To work like that impi-libraries require your project to implement some basic functions in a specific way. This library can be library to understand at first, but bear with us because after reading this instruction we hope that you'll understand how powerful is this approach.
